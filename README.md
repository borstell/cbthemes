# cbthemes
Custom themes for ggplot2.

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("borstell/cbthemes")
```

## Purpose
This package is mainly for personal use in order to quickly get some custom theme and styling options that I tend to use.

The package is inspired by Krause, Rennie & Tarran's R package [{RSSthemes}](https://github.com/nrennie/RSSthemes).
