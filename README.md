# cbthemes
Custom themes for ggplot2.

## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("borstell/cbthemes")
```

## Purpose
This package is mainly for personal use in order to quickly get some custom theme and styling options that I tend to use.

The default font family is [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible), which needs to be installed locally to be able to plot with default settings. Color and palettes are defined within the package itself.

The package is inspired by Krause, Rennie & Tarran's R package [{RSSthemes}](https://github.com/nrennie/RSSthemes).
